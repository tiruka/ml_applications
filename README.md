# About This Repogitory

This Repository includes various machine learning applications codes which are written by Python, Tensorflow and Keras.
For example, you can see auto-coloring, style-transfer, and super-resolution applications.
Those application theory are based on famous essays and I have written down on them.

If you would like to try it, you will git-clone this repository and put image data(jpg or png) on the indicated directory (mainly `data`) and run the application such as `python main.py train`.
